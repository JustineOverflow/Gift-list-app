# Gift app - Project

## Project concept


- Creating a gift list (example: for Christmas)
- Sharing this list with friends/guests
- Enabling them to select the gift they want to offer
- Once they select a gift, it is deleted from the list to avoid double gift
- The author of the list cannot see the gifts selected by the friends,  so they have the surprise. 

## Technologies used

- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- HTML
- CSS

### Ongoing project
